            Hi, and thank you for visiting my page! 
            <br>
            <br>
            I'm Sabrina and I'm on a journey to becoming a full-stack developer. I grew up in Hawthorne, California where I reside to this day. Growing up
          I loved to draw and play video games. It was a form of expression for me as I didn't have much control in other aspects of my life. I went to a private school all of elementary and then spent four years in an even stricter high school: Hawthorne Math and Science Academy (yes,
          it's as terrible as it sounds).
          <br>
          <br>
          However, while attenting I was introduced to programming via Scratch. I had a lot of fun playing around on Scratch; it was another avenue for self expression, but it wasn't
          until college that I seriously considered programming as a career. On a whim, I took C and Swift classes at my local community college. I had the same professor for both
          classes and even though I struggled a lot, I can honestly say my professor for those classes encouraged me and motivated me to pursue a career in development. Now, I look forward to diving deeper and expanding my knowledge in a  world that is full of new emerging and everchanging technologies.</p>
