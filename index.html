          reside to this day. Growing up
          I loved to draw and play video games. It was a form of expression for me as I didn't have much control in other aspects
          of my life. I went to a private school
          all of elementary and then spent four years in an even stricter high school: Hawthorne Math and Science Academy (yes,
          it's as terrible as it sounds).
          <br>
          However, while attenting I was introduced to programming via Scratch. I had so much fun playing around on Scratch; it
          was another avenue for self expression, but it wasn't
          until college that I seriously considered programming as a career. On a whim, I took C and Swift classes at my local
          community college. I had the same professor for both
          classes and even though I struggled a lot, I can honestly say my professor for those classes encouraged me and helped me
          succeed. I learned to enjoy programming in those
          classes, however basic they may have been. Now, I look forward to diving deeper and expanding my knowledge to the best
          of my ability.</p>
