            Hi, and thank you for visiting my page!
            <br>
            <br>
            Growing up I loved to draw and play video games. It was a form of expression for me as I didn't have much
            control in
            other aspects of my life. I went to a private school all of elementary and then spent four years in an even
            stricter
            high school: Hawthorne Math and Science Academy (yes, it's as terrible as it sounds).
            <br>
            <br>
            While attending I was introduced to programming via Scratch, however, it wasn't until college that I seriously considered programming
            as a career.
            On a whim, I took C and Swift classes at my local community college. I hit the jackpot. I wanted to learn
            more. I needed
            to know more. The desire to create something I was proud of from the bottom up fueled my fire. It was then I
            decided to
            pursue a career in development.
            <br>
            <br>
            I took the dive and enrolled in a Full Stack Development bootcamp where I honed my skills and watched
            hundreds of hours
            of videos on everything from basic Javascript to advanced algorithms.
            <br>
            <br>
            Now, I look forward to diving deeper and expanding my knowledge in a world that is full of new, emerging and
            ever-changing technologies.
            <br>
            <br>
            Proficiencies: Javascript, HTML/CSS, Node.js, MySQL, Firebase, React, MongoDB, Handlebars.js, Express, jQuery, Passport, JSON web tokens, Heroku, Material UI
